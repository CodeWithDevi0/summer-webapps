Introduction to PHP

Php is a server side and general-purpose scripting programming language more suited for web development.

php originally stood for personal home page but now it stands for php: hypertext preprocessor.
It's a recursive acronym because the first word is also an acronym.

PHP was created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. It's currently maintained by the PHP Development Team.

PHP is a server-side language:

When you open a website on your web browser, for example, https://www.google.com,
the browser sends a request to a server.
The server then sends back the website's content to the browser.
in this example, the web browser is the client and the server is the computer that hosts the website.
PHP runs on the web server, processes the request, and returns the HTML document to the browser.

PHP is a general-purpose language:

Regarding the purpose of programming languages, there are two main categories:

1. General-purpose languages:
- These languages are designed to be used for a wide range of tasks.
- They are not specialized for any particular task.
- They are versatile and can be used to build a wide range of applications.
- They are the most popular languages in the world.

2. Domain-specific languages:
- These languages are designed to be used for a specific task.
- They are specialized for a particular task.
- They are not versatile and can only be used to build applications for that specific task.
- They are not the most popular languages in the world.
- It's used mainly for querying data from relational databases and cannot be used for other purposes.

PHP is a cross-platform language:

PHP can run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
This means that PHP code can be written once and run on any platform that supports PHP.

PHP can be used with all leading web servers, such as Nginx, OpenBSD, and Apache.
Some cloud environments, such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS, also support PHP.

PHP is quite flexible. It’s not just limited to processing HTML.
PHP supports generating PDF, GIF, JPEG, and PNG images.

One notable feature of PHP is that it supports many databases,
including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, db2, Oracle Database, and MongoDB.

What can PHP do?

PHP has two main applications:

1. Server-side scripting:
PHP is well-suited for developing dynamic web pages and web applications.

2. Command-line scripting:
Like python and perl, you can run PHP scripts from the command line to perform
administrative tasks like sending emails and generating PDF files.
